# Blockchain

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers. It is designed to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of data. Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block through a cryptographic hash, forming a chain. This structure ensures that once a block is added, it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, making the blockchain tamper-resistant. Blockchains are used in various applications, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, supply chain management, and smart contracts, to facilitate secure and transparent record-keeping.
